h2. Helper Test Generator

Makes stubs so you can test helpers.

The helpers are placed in test/unit/helpers and will be run automatically whenever unit tests are run.

h3. Usage

Run the helper_test generator with the shortened name of the helper you want to test.

*For TaskHelper:*

@./script/generate helper_test Task@

(Note that it doesn't automagically guess plural endings, so for PostsHelper, you want "generate helper_test Posts", NOT "generate helper_test Post".)

h3. Examples

*Make a test for the BlogHelper:*

@./script/generate helper_test Blog@

*Make a test for Admin::UsersHelper:*

@./script/generate helper_test Admin::Users@

Sub-folders will be made, if necessary.
